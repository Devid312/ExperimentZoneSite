<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p>Skin Actives‚Äô comprehensive assortment offers the visitor a full range of solutions for her skin. This breadth of options can make identifying the right product cumbersome ‚Äì especially for visitors unfamiliar with the product offering. The Skin Actives‚Äô team desired to make product decisions easier for visitors.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="our-strategy">Our Strategy</h2>

<p>To reduce the steps in a guest‚Äôs search, we proposed focusing her attention on a popular subset of products. Skin Actives had a ‚ÄúBest Sellers‚Äù category in their navigation, but it was tucked beneath other categories and de-emphasized on the site. For the experiment, our team relocated this category to the main level navigation.</p>

<p>For desktop visitors, the category appeared in the top level of the navigation. For mobile visitors, the category was present as a top level category when the main menu was opened. By drawing attention to the ‚ÄúBest Sellers‚Äù section, we anticipated seeing an increase in overall orders and revenue growth.</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>

<p>We were successful in increasing the prominence ‚Äì and interactions with the Best Sellers category. By increasing the prominence of the ‚ÄúBest Sellers‚Äù category, we saw a large lift in the number of visitors viewing this page. <strong>Mobile visitors were +237% more likely to visit the category; desktop visitors were +242% more likely to see the Best Seller page</strong> in their visit.</p>

<p>The impact of seeing this page had very different impacts to what visitors did next. We saw a 17% decrease in visitors adding to cart on desktop. Desktop visitors may have been less convinced by the limited product selection on the Best Sellers page.</p>

<p>Focusing on the Best Sellers category ultimately led to a <strong>21% increase in orders on mobile</strong>. Without this shortcut, mobile visitors were having more friction finding the right product for them. Relocating the Best Sellers category simplified their decision making and helped them commit to a purchase.</p>

<p>Based on the experiment, Skin Actives permanently added the ‚ÄúBest Seller‚Äù category to the main menu on mobile and maintained the original menu on desktop. By implementing these changes Skin Actives projects an <strong>8% increase in total annual online revenue</strong>.</p>
