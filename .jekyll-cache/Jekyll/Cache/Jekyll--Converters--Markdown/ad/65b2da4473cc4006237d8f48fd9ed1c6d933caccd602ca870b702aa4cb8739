          <p>I had a 1h consult with AJ of Experiment Zone and was blown away by how much actual value I received from the consultation! AJ went through my entire customer journey with me on the call and provided actionable insights and pointers for improvement to increase conversion rate. I even received a detailed deck summary of the pointers specific to my brand after my call. I highly recommend any e-commerce business owners to have this chat with AJ - All value, no pushy sales! Thank you AJ. </p>

          <p>Hot Take On Conversion Optimization:<br /><br />It's SO HARD! I thought that my website UX skills were solid, but I learned something from AJ Davis at Experiment Zone.<br /><br />I was way to close to my product. I had been staring at our website for The Ronin Society for weeks and I went through a few different stages:<br /><br />I LOVE IT<br />I HATE IT<br />I LOVE IT AGAIN<br />I HATE IT AGAIN<br />I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT<br /><br />Luckily, AJ and her team at Experiment Zone are giving the gift of a free conversion consult as part of the #COVIDCRAP initiative.<br /><br />Thanks for the helpful advice for improving our conversions!
