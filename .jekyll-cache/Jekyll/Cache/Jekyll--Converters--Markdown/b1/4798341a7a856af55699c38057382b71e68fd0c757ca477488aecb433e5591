<p>There are a ton of software tools on the market. Many businesses set them - and forget them. Don’t make that mistake!</p>

<p>At Experiment Zone, we choose tools based on the value of the insights they provide. Our philosophy is to identify a specific research question before collecting the data. You’ll know why you are using the tool and what you will learn. You avoid a tsunami of inactionable data.</p>

<h2 id="well-cover-three-primary-categories-of-tools">We’ll cover three primary categories of tools:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Collecting insights to generate good ideas.
You’ll be able to answer questions like “Where are my visitors getting stuck?” and “Why are my visitors leaving my site on this page?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>Tools for evaluating your ideas, so you can focus on the best ones.
You’ll answer questions like “What test ideas should I start with?” and “What should my <a class="glossary-word" href="https://experimentzone.com/support/glossary/#AB-Testing">A/B testing</a> roadmap look like?”</li>
  <li>Tools for running your A/B tests, so you can measure the impact of your ideas
You’ll be able to answer “What was the revenue impact of that UX change?” and “How do my customers respond in the real world to these theoretic improvements?”</li>
</ol>

    <p>What can you learn? <a class="glossary-word" href="https://experimentzone.com/support/glossary/#Click-Tracking">Click tracking</a> tools are great for understanding where visitors focus their attention. Do they scroll to your primary CTA? Are their clicks focused on high value buttons?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="ethnio">Ethnio</h4>

    <p>To understand why visitors behave the way they do, you should set up usability studies. You can use a tool like <a href="https://ethn.io/" target="\_blank">Ethnio</a> to intercept visitors and invite them to participate in your remote UX research, online exercises and surveys.</p>

    <p>What can you learn? Get feedback from your actual visitors. Why are they on your website? What is confusing about your site or product?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="five-second-test">Five Second Test</h4>

    <p>Every landing page should run through the <a href="https://fivesecondtest.com/" target="\_blank">Five Second Test</a> by <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/" target="\_blank">Usability Hub</a>. This tool presents a site for 5 seconds before asking a question (which you choose).</p>

    <p>What can you learn?
First impressions of new visitors. Do new visitors understand what this website is offering? Do they understand what action they can take on my site?</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h2 id="top-tools-for-managing-test-ideas">Top Tools for Managing Test Ideas</h2>

<p>You can’t - and shouldn’t - test every idea on your website. Testing requires time, traffic, and money. By managing and prioritizing your tests, you can focus your experimentation efforts on high ROI opportunities.

  <li>
    <h4 id="google-sheets">Google Sheets</h4>

    <p>A simple, collaborative spreadsheet tool like <a href="http://sheets.google.com/" target="\_blank">Google Sheets</a> can be a great starting point for teams. You can keep a running list of the test ideas and use formulas to calculate scores for each idea. Google Sheets often falls short as teams expand and need a more robust solution for prioritization and test project management.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="asana">Asana</h4>

    <p>A project management tool like <a href="https://asana.com/" target="\_blank">Asana</a> or <a href="https://trello.com/" target="\_blank">Trello</a> can help your team understand what tests are being worked on and what is coming up next. These tools can be used in conjunction with prioritization meetings, but fall short for scoring and prioritizing ideas remotely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="hypothesis-library">Hypothesis Library</h4>

    <p>We have to include our product, the <a href="https://hypothesislibrary.com" target="\_blank">Hypothesis Library</a>. This tool is perfect for remote teams collaborating on collecting and evaluating test ideas. You can keep track of your test roadmap and results all in one place.</p>
