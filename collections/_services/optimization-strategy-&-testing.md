## Step 1 | Generate Test Ideas

We'll evaluate your current site experience. We'll review your current analytics data and do a heuristic walkthrough of your site experience, so we can understand where visitors get stuck and identify test ideas for testing.

**We'll share our test ideas with your team in the hypothesis library, where you can manage your AB testing ideas in one place. You'll receive access to the hypothesis library during kickoff.**

## Step 2 | Evaluate Test Ideas

We score each test idea to determine the most impactful and feasible ideas for A/B Testing using a scoring model tailored to your organizationâ€™s goals. We'll build a testing roadmap based on the best ideas on the most impactful pages.

**We'll review the testing roadmap during our kickoff because we begin testing.**

## On-Going Conversion Services | Bi-weekly Meetings & Iterative Testing

We will begin development on at least 2 A/B tests each month. Each test will go through five/six stages:

- Test Plan
- Test Design
- Test Development
- Test QA & Launch
- Test Analysis
- Test Implementation

You'll receive updates at each bi-weekly meeting on the current & upcoming tests. We will get your approval at each stage before moving to the next stage.

**We'll test & iterate each month, building on our learnings from previous tests and other data inputs.**

## Supporting Services | User Research & Analytics

We will periodically conduct additional services to enhance our understanding of the conversion opportunities on your site. These may include:

- **Analytics Review:** Includes reviewing analytics reporting to find opportunities to improve conversion rate and ensure we're focused on the most impactful pages.

- **Clicking Tracking & Heatmaps:** Includes setting up click tracking on key pages across the site to understand how visitors move, scroll, and click on the site.

- **UX Audit:** Includes reviewing the key user journeys for testing opportunities.

- **User Research Survey or Usability Study:** Collecting information from target customers to uncover usability issues on the site.

This agreement includes at least 4 supporting services for each 12 month period. Additional services can be added or can replace testing slots.
